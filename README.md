- Adding UITest
- Coverage should be at least 85%-90%
- Integating CI-CD will be a better option
- App Security can be enhanced through SSL pinning
- Integrating some king of analytics will be a good option. (firebase/ appDynamics)
- All hardcoded string should have come from a `.string` file, which will give us a control over supporting multi language app.
